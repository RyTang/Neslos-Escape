# Neslos-Escape
Link to Game: https://rytang.github.io/Neslos-Escape/

A Unity Project Inspired by my brother's Hamster (Neslo) that Escaped and Never Returned and by a Google's Dinosaur game. The timespan of this project **took roughly a week** from start to completion during a holiday break that I had; this is inclusive of art + music.

All game assets, music and code are written and created by me.

## Tool Used:
This game was created in Unity which mainly uses C# to create the fundamental game logic. The game's version were managed using Github at all times. You will be unable to view the source code itself here however, do feel free to contact me through LinkedIn to learn more about how I created this project.

Unity, C#, Github
