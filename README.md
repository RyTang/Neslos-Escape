# Neslos-Escape
Link to Game: https://rytang.github.io/Neslos-Escape/

A Unity Project Inspired by my Brother's Hamster that Escaped and never returned and by a Google's Dinosaur game. The timespan of this project **took roughly a week** from start to completion during a holiday break that I had.

All game assets, music and code are written and created by me.

## Tool Used:
This game was created in Unity which mainly uses C# to create the fundamental game logic. The game's version were managed using Github at all times.

Unity, C#, Github
