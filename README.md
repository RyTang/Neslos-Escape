# Neslos-Escape
Link to Game: https://rytang.github.io/Neslos-Escape/

A Unity Project Inspired by my brother's Hamster (Neslo) that Escaped and Never Returned and by a Google's Dinosaur game. The timespan of this project **took roughly a week** from start to completion during a holiday break that I had; this is inclusive of art + music.

All game assets, music and code are written and created by me.

## Tool Used:
This game was created in Unity which mainly uses C# to create the fundamental game logic. The game's version were managed using Github at all times. You will be unable to view the source code itself here however, do feel free to contact me through LinkedIn to learn more about how I created this project.

Unity, C#, Github

## Methodologies [(Code Structure Link)](https://github.com/RyTang/Neslos-Escape/tree/main/Game%20Code/Scripts):
The focus of this game was my attempt in understanding and coding my best in programming using a modular programming paradigm. Having each and every singular functionality be as modular as possible. However, it was incredibly hard to faithfully follow the focus especially when I am not as adept in Unity. Therefore, there were lots of research and mechanism, especially game design, that had to be researched while developing the game.
